Note: Shopping cart was previously mocked in assignment 4. Re-included here along with mocks for a Wishlist page, which is new and I have not previously designed. I chose to do a simple wishlist that included the ability to add to cart so as to ensure customers a good, smooth experience when they returned to their wishlist looking to buy something. There is a wishlist heart button implemented on each product detail page that would save the exact shape, color and fill that you wanted.
Shopping cart is implemented in HTML/CSS/JS ('cart.html'). 
Also, all product detail pages can be reached from the ‘product_list.html’ page.
